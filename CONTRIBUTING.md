# Contributing to peregrine-lti

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## Code of Conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed/added APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/StevenWeathers/go-templates/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Coding Conventions

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [Code Review Comments Guide](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) from the Go project as much as possible within reason.

## Authors
